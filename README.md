This repository showcases a common mistake in Elixir when using `Enum.reduce`. The `bug.exs` file contains code that incorrectly handles the accumulator, leading to an unexpected result. The `bugSolution.exs` file provides a corrected version that addresses this issue. The problem arises from not properly returning the accumulator in all branches of the `if` statement within the reducer function.
